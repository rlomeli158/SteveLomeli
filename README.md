Hello!

Thanks for visiting github. I've split up my work into the different coding languages I've worked with. 

The python folder has some introductory work along with algorithms. The SQL folder has some code I used in my database management class. And finally, the Web App Development folder has a website my team and I made in the fall semester of 2020. 

To view more functionality, you can long in. The username is: "m.sheffield@mainstreetmovies.com" and the password is: "longhorns".
